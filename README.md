# alexa-ipcam-viewer
I've started this project in order to learn how to create Alexa Skills. Using the instructions below you will be able to create a Skill and connect your home cameras to Alexa Devices and Live View them after saying "Alexa show me the <IPCAM Name>".

I looked for other projects on GitHub for code to leverage but didn't find anything exactly solving my particular problem. However I did find an excellent repo called CameraPi from Sam Machin that describes how to use Alexa to control a camera connected to a Raspberry PI that I used as a basis for my effort. Thank you Sam!

I used emtunc's very cool blog to learn how to setup the RTSP proxy. Thank you emtunc!
