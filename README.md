# alexa-ipcam-viewer
I've started this project in order to learn how to create Alexa Skills. Using the instructions below you will be able to create a Skill and connect your home cameras to Alexa Devices and Alexa Anroid App and after saying "Alexa show me the <IPCAM Name>" you will be able to see the camera stream.

I looked for other projects for code to leverage and find the repo called https://github.com/goruck/alexa-ip-cam which almost cover all my requirements, with very good instructions, except that the Alexa Android App is not supported for Live View. So my aim is to improve the https://github.com/goruck/alexa-ip-cam to work also on Android Alexa App. Another interesting project from which I'ce started coding is https://github.com/sammachin/camerapi. Thank you all!
I also used all the resources and documentation in the https://developer.amazon.com.

I used emtunc's very cool blog to learn how to setup the RTSP proxy. Thank you emtunc!
